## **Design**

### **Colour Scheme**

Colour Palette image

The colours used in the page are blue and pink/purple and various shades and opacity values of the same.
For the add/remove buttons the red and blue are used.

this colour choice was directly inspired by the logo image used and the whole page is set up to contrast the two colours using linear gradient diagonally.
Purpose of this was to connect the favicon, logo and the page itself into one cohesive unit always connected with these two colours.

The buttons for adding income/expense are shaded blue with hover effect using darker shade of blue. The remove button for income/expense are shaded red and then darker red on hover.
Other buttons have linear gradient with both pink and blue on hover.

### **Typography**

The fonts were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Link to Google fonts page") database.
Roboto is used throughout the site, quick google search suggested the font as good option for budgeting needs. 
The font has a back-up font in case the selected doesn't load for the user, sans-serif.

### **Imagery**

<!-- image  -->

The image is used as the logo and favicon.
It was also used as a source for the inspiration for the general colour use through the project.

### **Structure**
  * Budget Calculator website is structured in a user friendly and easy to navigate way.
  * When the page first loads, the user is met with all the info needed for successful budget calculation
  * The title of the page in the header explains what the site is and it's purpose
  * If additional info is needed there is 'About' clickable element where the user would expect it (top right corner), it opens an overlay modal with additional info
  * Modal overlays are implemented to warn the user if anything is wrong/needs to have input before the calculation can take place
  * There is a dropdown menu for currency selection, when it is selected the results will show the currency too
  * The name input is required becuse it changes the heading of the site to include the user's name
  * The income/expense inputs for name are not mandatory but the values (numbers) are, this is to facilitate quicker calculation if the user needs it
  * There are add/remove buttons for income and expenses, the user can add as many as needed, but cannot remove the first input fields
  * The results of the budget calculation are shown including total income/expenses including the currency selected
  * The print button is below the 'Calculate Budget' button should the user wish to print the page
  * The date and time display is present to keep track of when the user did the calculation, it updates every second
  * The 'Reset Form' button resets the whole page to initial state, clearing all input fields, results and added income/expenses
  * The footer area contains basic copyright and name of the author plus GitHub icon that opens the author's GitHub profile in new tab
